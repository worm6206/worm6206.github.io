I'm Kevin Yen, a 1st-year Computer Science Engineering master student at Ohio State University.  \r\n\r\nI'm working with Han-wei Shen on some interesting Visualization-related projects. That said, my interests doesn't only lie in Visualization. I've also done some work on Human-Computer Interaction, and am still exploring other fields for any possible integration with visualization, such as machine-learning and data-mining.\r\n\r\n### Come around sometime later\r\nSite should be ready before middle of August, please visit then for some showoffs!",
